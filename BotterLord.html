      <br> My personal side project that was inspired by *TIS-100, EmpireMud and Overlord Novels by Kugane Maruyama.* <br>
      <br> The plan is to create a DOS inspired retro castle management/strategy game where you personally will be responsible for the Npc's AIs, and hopefully a lot more.<br>
      <br> Mind that the screenshot is from the **old version**, in the new concept there won't be a map but instead of a realtime visual of the castle.<br>
      <br> The reasons for purging the map idea was because it wasn't really going along with the main mechanic of the game which is micromanagement, while also taking a lot of time and effort to make it work like it should. And thus I decided that it
      would be better to make a great game with less fancy mechanics than a game with tons of barely working mechanics.<br>
